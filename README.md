# Vim

This is my vim configuration file.

## Usage

To use this configuration, copy the .vimrc file into your home folder.

## Installing Plugins

Plugins are managed using [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). To use it, create a .vim/bundle directory in your home folder and clone the Vundle.vim github repository inside of that directory. then run `:PluginInstall` inside vim to automatically install all plugins.
