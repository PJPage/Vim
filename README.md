# Vim

This is my vim configuration file.

## Usage

To use this configuration in Windows, copy the \_vimrc file into your C:\Users\\\<username> ("home") folder and install the plugins as shown below. In Linux, you can skip both of these steps by simply running `install_linux.sh`.

## Installing Plugins

Plugins are managed using [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). To use it, create a .vim/bundle directory in your home folder and clone the Vundle.vim github repository inside of that directory. then run `:PluginInstall` inside vim to automatically install all plugins.
